## 🧰 Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Fix |
|-------|-------------|
| Extension not connecting | Check if your backend URL is correct and accessible |
| "CORS" or network error | Ensure your backend allows cross-origin requests (CORS middleware in FastAPI) |
| First request slow | Render's free tier sleeps after inactivity — wait ~30 seconds |

---

## 💡 Notes

- You don't need to run the backend locally, since it's already deployed.
- Any time you update your backend code on GitHub, Render auto-redeploys.
- Your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` remains safely stored as an environment variable in Render.
